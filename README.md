### Project Description/Outline 
Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. Our analysis aims to understand the relationships of rideshare pricing when compared against external factors like time of day, day of the week and possibly even weather. The dataset we are analyzing covers simulated rides between a few hot locations in Boston, MA taken in the span of about a week in Nov/Dec of 2018.


### Research Questions to Answer - 

***
1. General Behavior of Car Ride Frequency
2. How are Car Rides affected by different Weather Conditions?
3. How is Price & Revenue affected by Distance Travelled/Weather?
4. Deep Dive on Surge Effectiveness in ride revenue
5. Statistical Analysis of Combined Weather: Ride Relationships
6. Final Summary (? Write Up)

#### General Behavior of Car Ride Frequency
- Percentage Distribution against Uber & Lyft
- Preferred Distance Travelled by each App
- Average Rate of Rides on a given day of the week
- Preference of Ride Type

#### How are Car Rides affected by different Weather Conditions?
- Relationships of Rides Affected by Rainfall, Wind Speed, and Cloudiness
- 

#### How is Price & Revenue affected by Distance Travelled/Weather?
- Relationships between Ride Type and Destination (Boston University & Northeastern University)
- 

#### Deep Dive on Surge Effectiveness in ride revenue
- Max Surge depending on the Day of the Week
- Time Series showing the frequency of Surge throughout the day
- 

#### Statistical Analysis of Combined Weather: Ride Relationships
- Heat map
- Summary statistics of Ride relationships with pricing (IQR, Outliers, Quartiles)
- ANOVA Testing
