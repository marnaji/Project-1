### Project Description/Outline 
Uber and Lyft's ride prices are not constant like public transport. They are greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time. Our analysis aims to understand the relationships of rideshare pricing when compared against external factors like time of day, day of the week and possibly even weather. The dataset we are analyzing covers simulated rides between a few hot locations in Boston, MA taken in the span of about a week in Nov/Dec of 2018.


### Research Questions to Answer - 

1 - Weather relationship to Ride Time ?
